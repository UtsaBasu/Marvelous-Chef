METHOD
To make the ice cream, simply put everything into a bowl and use an electric hand mixer to whisk all the ingredients together thoroughly.

Then pour the mixture into the polythene freezer box and place it in the coldest part of the freezer. After about 2 hours, or when the edges are starting to freeze, remove it and use the hand mixer to give it another good mix and break down any ice crystals. Return to the freezer, then repeat the whisking after 3 more hours.

Finally, return it to the freezer for a further 6 to 8 hours, by which time it should be at serving consistency. If you've made it a long time ahead and it's very hard, transfer it to the main body of the fridge for 30 minutes to soften enough to scoop.

To make the chocolate fudge sauce, all you do is pour the evaporated milk into a small heatproof bowl, then break up the chocolate into small squares and add them to the milk. Place the bowl on a saucepan of barely simmering water, making sure the bottom doesn't touch the water, and leave the chocolate to melt, stirring from time to time. It will take about 10 minutes to become a lovely fudgy mass.

To serve the sundaes, put three scoops of very firm, cold ice cream per person into tall glasses, followed by 3 dessertspoons of hot fudge sauce, followed by 1 dessertspoon whipped cream or crème fraîche. Finally sprinkle over some chopped nuts and serve absolutely immediately.

Note: Because of the sugar content in condensed milk, this recipe is not suitable for ice-cream makers.
